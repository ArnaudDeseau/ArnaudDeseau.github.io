I am a PhD student in Economic History at <a href="https://www.usaintlouis.be/" target="_blank">Université Saint-Louis – Bruxelles</a> and <a href="https://uclouvain.be/fr/index.html" target="_blank">UCLouvain</a> (Belgium) under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/helene-latzer/home" target="_blank">Hélène Latzer</a> and <a href="https://perso.uclouvain.be/david.delacroix/" target="_blank">David de la Croix</a>. My research focuses on the determinants and the evolution of economic development in a long-run perspective. More specifically, my research looks at the historical evolution of access to justice, Malthusian dynamics and the long-run impact of the dissolution of French monasteries.</div>
