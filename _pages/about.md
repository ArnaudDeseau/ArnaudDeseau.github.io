<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am a PhD student in Economics at <a href="https://www.usaintlouis.be/" target="_blank">Université Saint-Louis – Bruxelles</a> and <a href="https://uclouvain.be/fr/index.html" target="_blank">UCLouvain</a> (Belgium) under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/helene-latzer/home" target="_blank">Hélène Latzer</a> and <a href="https://perso.uclouvain.be/david.delacroix/" target="_blank">David de la Croix</a>.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
<br/> My research spans economic growth, political economy, demography and economic history. More specifically, my research centers on understanding the role of institutions and social change in long-run development. Another strand of my research studies the co-evolution of economic and demographic forces (Malthusian trap) before the Industrial Revolution.</div>
  
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
<br/>I am currently full-time teaching assistant at Université Saint-Louis – Bruxelles. Prior to that, I obtained my Master at the Economics School of Louvain (UCLouvain, Belgium) in 2016.</div>
