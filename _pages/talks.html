With Adam Levai and Michèle Schmiegelow, I constructed a new database on the total number of professional judges per 100,000 inhabitants by collecting data from various public institutions. We draw on those data as a proxy for the historical evolution of ATJ from 1970 through 2014 for a wide range of
developed and developing countries. Available upon request.

During medievel times, monasteries were places of spitirual activity; but not only. Monasteries were important economic actors possesing significant amount of land, forests, mills, houses and forges. More importantly, they were true feudal landlords, collecting taxes and exercising feudal rights on land. At the eve of the French Revolution, the Church posseses as much as 6-7% of the land and monasteries are a high contributor of that figure (Bodinier and Teyssier, 2000). After the revolution, in the space of 3 years, the vast majority of monasteries and their possessions were sold by auction in the event called La Vente des Biens Nationaux. The aim of this project is to i) reconstruct the revenue of Ancien Régime French monasteries and ii) study the economic and social consequences of the dissolution of the French monasteries.
