During medieval times, monasteries were places of spiritual activity; but not only. Monasteries were also important economic actors possessing significant amount of the land, forests, mills, houses and forges. More importantly, they were true feudal landlords, collecting taxes and exercising feudal rights on the land. At the eve of the French Revolution, the Church possesed as much as 6-7% of the land and monasteries accounted for a significant part of that figure (Bodinier and Teyssier, 2000). After the revolution, in the space of three years, the vast majority of monasteries and their possessions were sold by auction in the event called <em>La Vente des Biens Nationaux</em>. The aim of this project is to i) reconstruct the revenue of <em>Ancien Régime</em> French monasteries and ii) study the economic and social consequences of the dissolution of the French monasteries.

One of the most central prediction of the Malthusian theory is that standards of living were stagnant before the onset of industrialization. Stagnation however does not literally mean constant, or flat, per capita income. In fact, any shock striking a Malthusian economy generates fluctuations, or volatility, in the standards of living, namely temporary or non-sustained economic growth. Indeed, a simple Malthusian model predicts that a positive shock on the technology level – say the introduction of better cultivation techniques – increases income per capita in the short run only; in the long run, population increases and the economy returns to its initial level of income per capita. This is the so-called “Malthusian trap” mechanism, that has been recognized as one of the major obstacles to achieve sustained economic growth during millennia (Kremer, 1993; Galor and Weil, 2000; Hansen and Prescott, 2002; Clark, 2007; Ashraf and Galor, 2011; Galor, 2011). 
<br/>
While the existence of the Malthusian trap mechanism is widely accepted, previous literature has found mixed evidence about its exact strength. A first group of studies finds evidence of weak <em>homeostasis</em>, with half-lives ranging from one (Lee and Anderson, 2002; Fernihough, 2013; Bouscasse et al., 2021) to several centuries (Crafts and Mills, 2009). On the other hand, Madsen et al. (2019) find evidence of strong homeostasis, with half-lives ranging between 10 and 30 years. In this project, I investigate the question of the strength of the Malthusian trap by examining the speed of convergence of Malthusian economies to their steady state – i.e. the time it takes them to go back to their steady state after a shock.

The last decade has seen a growing recognition of Access to Justice (ATJ) as one of the major challenges in the development of peaceful and prosperous societies for the coming years. A study conducted by the World Justice Project in 2019 estimates that as much as 5.1 billion people – or approximately two-thirds of humanity – face issues related to ATJ. The obstacles to reaching justice are numerous, ranging from time and costs factors to discrimination of all kinds; they impede the accurate delivery of justice in civil, administrative, and criminal matters. This has direct and strong implications for peoples’everyday decisions in the most fundamental economic operations. Consequently, such obstacles to justice generate substantial economic costs and slows down economic development in both developed and developing societies.
<br/>
Although existing contributions to the literature have stressed the importance of legal codes as well as effective or de facto judicial institutions for economic development, surprisingly little is known about the importance of the central notion of ATJ for economic development. In this project, we take a long-run perspective to (i) trace the historical evolution of ATJ through time and accross country and (ii) evaluate the contribution of ATJ to economic development.
