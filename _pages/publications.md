The last decade has seen a growing recognition of access to justice (ATJ) as one of the major challenges in the development of peaceful and prosperous societies for the coming years. A study conducted by the World Justice Project (2019) estimates that as much as 5.1 billion people – or approximately two-thirds of humanity – face issues related to ATJ. The obstacles to reaching justice are numerous, ranging from time and costs factors to discrimination of all kinds; they impede the accurate delivery of justice in civil, administrative, and criminal matters. This has direct and strong implications for peoples’everyday decisions in the most fundamental economic operations. Consequently, such obstacles to justice generate substantial economic costs and slows down economic development in both developed and developing societies.
Although existing contributions to the literature have stressed the importance of legal codes as well as effective or de facto judicial institutions for economic development, surprisingly little is known about the importance of the central notion of ATJ for economic development. In this project, we take a long-run perspective to i) retrace the historical evolution of ATJ through time and accross country and ii) evaluates the contribution of ATJ to economic development.

In regard of Human History, modern growth is the great exception and Malthusian times, the rule. Named after Thomas Malthus (x-x), the Malthusian epoch starts 12,000 ago with the Neolithical Revolution and ends around 1750 with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. The key characteristic of Malthusian economies is the lThis economic system is characterized by the stagnation of the living conditions. 
Understanding the Malthusian economic system is key to resolve the mystery of the end of the Malthusian era and the onset of modern economic growth. Enven more important, the Great Divergence.
In this project, I start by analyzing the speed at which a Malthusian economy
