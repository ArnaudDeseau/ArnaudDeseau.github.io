During medieval times, monasteries were places of spiritual activity; but not only. Monasteries were also important economic actors possessing significant amount of the land, forests, mills, houses and forges. More importantly, they were true feudal landlords, collecting taxes and exercising feudal rights on the land. At the eve of the French Revolution, the Church possesed as much as 6-7% of the land and monasteries accounted for a significant part of that figure (Bodinier and Teyssier, 2000). After the revolution, in the space of three years, the vast majority of monasteries and their possessions were sold by auction in the event called <em>La Vente des Biens Nationaux</em>. The aim of this project is to i) reconstruct the revenue of <em>Ancien Régime</em> French monasteries and ii) study the economic and social consequences of the dissolution of the French monasteries.

In regard of Human History, modern growth is the great exception and Malthusian times, the rule. Named after Thomas Malthus (1766-1834), the Malthusian epoch starts 12,000 years ago with the Neolithic Revolution and ends around 1750 in England with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. Since decades now, economists have accumulated evidence in favour of the existence of the Malthusian period. The fundamental postulate of the Malthusian theory, directly related to Thomas Malthus's theories, is that long-run living standards were fixed at a <em>subsistance level</em> and determined by fertility and mortality only. Technological progress at that time influenced short-term living standards, not long. One key and closely related element is the concept of <em>Malthusian trap</em> - i.e. the mechanism by which fertility and mortality evolve to prevent long-run income per capita variations. One of the most famous and tragic example of Malthusian adjustment is The Black Death (1346-1353): right after the pestilence, the survivors enjoy higher income per capita; they have better chances to survive, they marry earlier and have more kids who have also better chances to survive; it results that population will increase faster than the total output, as we have diminishing returns on the agricultural land, and that income per capita will decrease. Generations after generations, population will converge to its pre-Black Death level and so will do income per capita.
<br/>
Since new GDP per capita data series showing upward trends prior 1800 (Fouquet & Broadberry, 2015), the Malthusian Trap is challenged in the litterature. To reconcile those new empirical facts and Malthusian theories, we need long lasting effect of shocks. In this project, I focus on the speed of convergence of a Malthusian economy to its steady-state - i.e. the time a Malthusian economy takes to return to its previous GDP per capita steady-state after a shock.

The last decade has seen a growing recognition of Access to Justice (ATJ) as one of the major challenges in the development of peaceful and prosperous societies for the coming years. A study conducted by the World Justice Project in 2019 estimates that as much as 5.1 billion people – or approximately two-thirds of humanity – face issues related to ATJ. The obstacles to reaching justice are numerous, ranging from time and costs factors to discrimination of all kinds; they impede the accurate delivery of justice in civil, administrative, and criminal matters. This has direct and strong implications for peoples’everyday decisions in the most fundamental economic operations. Consequently, such obstacles to justice generate substantial economic costs and slows down economic development in both developed and developing societies.
<br/>
Although existing contributions to the literature have stressed the importance of legal codes as well as effective or de facto judicial institutions for economic development, surprisingly little is known about the importance of the central notion of ATJ for economic development. In this project, we take a long-run perspective to i) retrace the historical evolution of ATJ through time and accross country and ii) evaluates the contribution of ATJ to economic development.
