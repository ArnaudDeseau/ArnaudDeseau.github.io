The last decade has seen a growing recognition of Access to Justice (ATJ) as one of the major challenges in the development of peaceful and prosperous societies for the coming years. A study conducted by the World Justice Project in 2019 estimates that as much as 5.1 billion people – or approximately two-thirds of humanity – face issues related to ATJ. The obstacles to reaching justice are numerous, ranging from time and costs factors to discrimination of all kinds; they impede the accurate delivery of justice in civil, administrative, and criminal matters. This has direct and strong implications for peoples’everyday decisions in the most fundamental economic operations. Consequently, such obstacles to justice generate substantial economic costs and slows down economic development in both developed and developing societies.
<br/>
Although existing contributions to the literature have stressed the importance of legal codes as well as effective or de facto judicial institutions for economic development, surprisingly little is known about the importance of the central notion of ATJ for economic development. In this project, we take a long-run perspective to i) retrace the historical evolution of ATJ through time and accross country and ii) evaluates the contribution of ATJ to economic development.

In regard of Human History, modern growth is the great exception and Malthusian times, the rule. Named after Thomas Malthus (1766-1834), the Malthusian epoch starts 12,000 ago with the Neolithical Revolution and ends around 1750 in England with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. One key characterisitc of the Malthusian era is the concept of Malthusian Trap - i.e. the stagnation of output per capita because of a positive link between output per capita and fertility. One most famous and tragic exemple is The Black Death: right after the pestilence, survivors enjoy a higher income per capita, they survive more, make more kids who enjoy better survival chance such that population growth 
<br/>
The Malthusian Trap is challenged in the litterature. In this project, I focus on the speed of convergence of a Malthusian economy to its steady-state - i.e. the time a Malthusian economy takes to return to its previous GDP per capita steady-state after a shock.

During medievel times, monasteries were places of spitirual activity; but not only. Monasteries were important economic actors possesing significant amount of land, forests, mills, houses and forges. More importantly, they were true feudal landlords, collecting taxes and exercising feudal rights on land. At the eve of the French Revolution, the Church posseses as much as 6-7% of the land and monasteries are a high contributor of that figure (Bodinier and Teyssier, 2000). After the revolution, in the space of 3 years, the vast majority of monasteries and their possessions were sold by auction in the event called La Vente des Biens Nationaux. The aim of this project is to i) reconstruct the revenue of Ancien Régime French monasteries and ii) study the economic and social consequences of the dissolution of the French monasteries.
